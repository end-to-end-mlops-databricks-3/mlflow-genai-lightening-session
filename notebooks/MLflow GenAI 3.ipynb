    "# Part 3: Custom MLflow Model\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow for GenAI Guide Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is part three of a four-part guide for using MLflow to experiment with and deploy your generative AI projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part one, we started with the problem of generating social media posts following the style of a set of example posts. We used MLautologging and tracing to keep track of our early informal experiments as we developed a simple prototype. In part two, we used MLflow's evaluation tools to set up and run a more structured experiment comparing the performance of a couple of different models and prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to prepare our GenAI application for production. In this part of the guide, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wrap our model logic in a custom MLflow `PyFunc` model, allowing us to keep track of model versions and configurations, specify how we would like tracing handled in different environments, and validate the model prior to serving.\n",
    "- Create a staging and production model in the model registry and register our custom model as a model version in the registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes you have read and worked through parts [one](../part_1) and [two](../part_2), and will frequently reference code and concepts introduced there. It also assumes you have followed the setup instructions detailed there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulating our Model Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have prototyped our GenAI application and refined that prototype through the evaluation process, settling on a model and prompt that generate posts that are accurate and that effectively copy the style of the example posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a working application, we need to prepare it for production use. We need to ensure that the application's interface is standardized and well defined so any downstream parts of the application, such as a frontend GUI, can effectively use the model. We also need to make sure the model environment and dependencies are recorded and packaged with the model in order to make sure the model can be deployed across different environments without dependency conflicts. Furthermore, encapsulating our application logic in a custom PyFunc model will allow us to keep track of model versions and configurations, specify how we would like tracing handled in different environments, and validate the model prior to serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "[MLflow models](/model) address these needs by providing a standardized way to save model logic, configurations, and dependencies. They also provide a standardized interface and deployment system, ensuring the model can be deployed and used across different environments.\n",
    "\n",

    "### ChatModel or PyFunc?\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow offers the [ChatModel](/llms/chat-model-intro/) class for setting up custom GenAI models with a chat interface. While this may seem like the obvious choice for our application, we will actually be using a custom [PyFunc](/model/python_model) model instead. Though our application *uses* a chat model, it is not, itself, a chat model: the inputs and outputs are not lists of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ChatModel interface is a great choice for developing and deploying conversational models with standardized input/output schemas following the OpenAI spec. PyFunc models, on the other hand, offer full control over the model interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the Custom Model\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key considerations we will make when defining the custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tracing:** We want to make sure tracing is easily configurable. There may, for example, be circumstances where tracing is not permissible in a production environment because of user data privacy concerns. To address cases like this, we will make tracing configurable via an environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configuration:** We will make some of the application's configuration, such as the system prompt and model provider, available to the model via a configuration dictionary. This is a good idea for parameters we expect we may want to change in the future. It will allow us to log updated versions of the model without needing to change the custom PyFunc model code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Models from Code:** We will save our model logic in a separate file called `model.py` and include the line `set_model(SocialPoster())` at the end of the file. When we log the model, we will set the `code_path` argument to `model.py`. This is the [models from code](/model/models-from-code) approach to logging models, which is a good fit for GenAI applications using LLM APIs, where there are no model weights that need to be serialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Input and Output Schema:** MLflow 2.20 introduced the ability to define model signatures for custom PyFunc models [using type hints](/model/python_model#model-signature-inference-based-on-type-hints) in the `predict` method. We will use this approach to define the input and output schema for our model.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `SocialPoster` class inherits from `PythonModel`. This is the base class for all custom PyFunc models. It requires a `predict` method that takes a `context` and a list of `model_input` and returns a list of `model_output`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The core application logic is implemented in the `predict` method. This method:\n",
    "  1. Checks whether tracing is enabled and sets it according to the `tracing_enabled` attribute using the `mlflow.tracing.enable()` and `mlflow.tracing.disable()` methods.\n",
    "  2. Starts a new tracing span with the name \"predict\" and the type \"CHAIN\". This span will be the parent span for the rest of the model's execution.\n",
    "  3. Assembles the prompt from the example posts, context, and additional instructions using the `_webpage_to_markdown` and `_generate_prompt` helper functions.\n",
    "  4. Generates a post using the using the `_generate_post` helper function.\n",
    "  5. Returns the generated post.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `predict` method calls the `_webpage_to_markdown`, `_generate_prompt`, and `_generate_post` helper functions that define specific steps in the application logic. We defined these functions in part 1 of this guide. Here, we add the `@mlflow.trace` decorator to the functions to make sure they are traced, giving us visibility into the application's execution flow and enabling us to diagnose any issues that may arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `load_context` method is called once when the model is loaded and is responsible for initializing model-specific attributes and resources. In our case, it loads configuration values from the model context, sets up tracing based on an environment variable, and initializes the appropriate client based on the configured model provider. This initialization approach ensures that our model has all necessary resources and configurations ready before any predictions are made, while keeping sensitive information like API keys separate from the model artifacts.\n"
